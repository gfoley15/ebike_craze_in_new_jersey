# ebike_craze_in_new_jersey

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the eBike Craze project, focusing on analyzing and visualizing New Jersey Citi Bike data from January 2023 to April 2024. This project explores year-over-year trends and insights into the utilization of eBikes versus Classic bikes, station contributions, and geographical patterns in bike usage.

## Data Processing
Data from monthly CSV files (2023 to April 2024) was merged using Pandas to facilitate analysis in Tableau. Due to the large dataset size, data was filtered to include January through April data from both years for efficient processing and visualization.

## Key Questions
The analysis explores the following questions:
- Are there more eBike rides than Classic bike rides?
- What is the dispersion and year-over-year increase in eBike rides compared to Classic bike rides?
- Which stations contribute most to the increase in eBike rides? Where are eBikes predominantly used?
- What are the geographical patterns of bike rides, and is there a correlation with US Median Household Income?

## Repository Structure
Notebooks: Jupyter notebook detailing data cleaning, merging, and initial analysis.
Visualizations: Visual output of graphs and charts created during data exploration.
